    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">**Last Updated:** September 25, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the **Personal Expenses App** (the "App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. The Offline Nature of the App - Your Financial Privacy</h2>
    <p>The core function of the **Personal Expenses App** is to be an entirely **offline-first** personal finance tracker. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Data Stays on Your Device:</strong> All of your personal expense records, weekly/monthly/yearly insights, and transaction data are stored locally on your mobile device.</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Uploads:</strong> We **do not** transmit, store, or have access to your financial transactions, categories, or personal expense amounts on any remote server.</li>
        <li><strong>No Internet Required for Core Functionality:</strong> You can use the app's primary features (tracking, managing, and viewing insights) without an internet connection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We are a privacy-focused application. We **do not** collect, store, or transmit the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.</li>
        <li>Your financial data, transaction details, or account balances.</li>
        <li>Any sensitive information from your device, such as contacts, photos, or location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information We May Collect (Non-Personal)</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services that may collect limited, non-personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of improving the App and its performance. This typically falls under:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash Reporting:</strong> We use tools (such as [e.g., Firebase Crashlytics]) to monitor when the app crashes. This data is technical (e.g., type of device, version of OS, crash report) and is used **only** to fix bugs and improve stability. It **does not** include your financial data or any personal identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics (Anonymized):</strong> We may use tools (such as [e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase]) to understand general usage trends (e.g., which screen is most popular, how many users open the app). This data is completely anonymized and aggregated and **cannot** be used to identify you or your specific financial records.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of this anonymized information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    <p>To support the development and maintenance of the App, we use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[List any third-party services you use, e.g., "Google Play Services" or "Firebase Crashlytics"] - **Purpose:** [Briefly state the purpose, e.g., "for device compatibility and crash reporting."]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties have their own Privacy Policies regarding their use of information. We encourage you to review them.</p>

    <h2>5. Security of Your Data</h2>
    <p>While the greatest security measure is keeping your data offline, we take steps to ensure the local storage of your data is protected. Since your financial information is stored only on your device, the security of that information is also dependent on the physical security and data protection measures (such as passcodes or biometrics) you use on your mobile device.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
