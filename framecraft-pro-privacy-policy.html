    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 10, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>IndianAppInnovations</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") operates the <strong>FrameCraft Pro</strong> mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>FrameCraft Pro is designed to be a private, ad-free experience. We do not require you to create an account to use the app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Media and Photos:</strong> Our app requires access to your device's gallery/storage to allow you to select photos for birthday frames and save the final edited images. These photos are processed locally on your device and are <strong>never</strong> uploaded to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, or contact list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Ad-Free Experience</h2>
    <p>FrameCraft Pro is a "No-Ads" application. We do not use third-party advertising networks, and therefore, no data is shared with advertisers for tracking or profiling purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. Since all image processing happens on your device, your photos remain under your control. We remind you to only share your created frames with trusted individuals on social media.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide its core features, the app may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage/Photos/Media:</strong> To read photos for editing and write the finished frame to your gallery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
